## Description
A database for cms was created with mysql and inquirer. 
I first started with creating the logic for javascript. Created a connection for the database in prompt_questions.js and in server.js, then created an array of options for questions to be be prompted with inquirier.
Each prompted question is linked to the database by id name. When prompt 'What would you like to do' user will be givin the option to view or add department, roles and employess. Once user chooses, the next array of options will be givin to pick from.
For viewing departments a list of departments will be given
For viewing roles a list of roles will be given with salary, and department_id.
For viewing employees a list of employees will given with first and last name, job title, department_name, salary and manager_id.
